## AI use
In this project i have used AI tools to help me in design, style, and link JavaScript with HTML element. I was facing difficulties in styling my website and the section looked very boring, so using GitHub Copilot helps me to add some effects to my components. Also, the JavaScript part was confusing me because I did not know how to use the HTML elements inside it, so ChatGPT explained to me how I can do that. I have learned new things and improve my skills through using AI tools effectively.
